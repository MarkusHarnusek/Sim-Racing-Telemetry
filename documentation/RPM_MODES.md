# RPM Modes

This document provides detailed information about the various RPM modes available in the Sim-Racing-Telemetry application.

## Overview
RPM modes determine how the RPM values are visually represented using 12 LEDs, 4 green, 4 red and 4 blue. These modes enhance the racing experience by providing clear and customizable visual feedback.

## Modes

### Normal Mode
In this mode, each of the 12 LEDs lights up sequentially as the RPM increases from the minimum RPM to the redline RPM. Once the RPM exceeds the redline, all LEDs flash to indicate the limit.

### Skip Mode
Similar to the Normal Mode, but the first RPM gauge segment is skipped. This mode starts lighting up LEDs from the second segment onward, providing a slightly different visual representation.

### Segments Mode
In this mode, each segment acts as a single LED. The segments light up sequentially as the RPM increases, and all segments flash when the RPM exceeds the redline.

These modes ensure efficient and customizable visual feedback, making them suitable for real-time applications in sim racing telemetry.
